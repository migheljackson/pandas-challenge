In this assignment, since I currently work in the education space, I decided to take a look through a data set for a fictional school district to see if any trends could be identified.  I first looked at the full district data and then grouped it by school, school size, school budget per student and school type to see if there were any apparent observations.  My observations are as follows:

Charter Schools Are Outperforming District Schools Across The Board:
When grouping the data by school type (Charter vs. District) and looking at the aggregate metrics around student test results, charter schools in this data set seem to far outperform their district counterparts.  Particularly in the metric that shows the percentage of students that passed overall (those that passed both the math and the reading assessment), 91% of Charter students passed compared to 54% within the district.

Diminishing Returns, Spending More Does Not Equal Success:
One seemingly counter-intuitive observation that came out of the spending range data was that student success (as measured by the overall percentage of students passing both the math and reading assessments) actually fell precipitously the more that a school spent per student.  The schools that spend the least per student had a 91% overall passing rate, while the schools that spent the most (more than $640 per student) had an abysmal 54% overall passing rate.

The Bigger They Are, The Harder They Fall:
The final observation that I made in this data set is when comparing school size to overall success rate, similar to more money equalling less success, more students also equates to less success on the math and reading assessments.  Only 58% of students at larger schools are able to pass both the math and english assessments w
